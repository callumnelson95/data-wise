When asked ""Today's sessions helped me articulate how and why equity is central to the work of school improvement."" I am putting somewhat disagree NOT because I don't believe equity is central to our work but because today's session did not help me articulate how and why it's important. I have learned the importance through my experiences working with my students of color, through critical conversations with colleagues, and through reading books by Ladson-Billings, Delpit, Tatum, etc.

I think in these sessions the Harvard staff could push people further to understand how central equity is to this work. Regardless of your race or what children you serve we all need to understand that the current climate of this country, the power structures in place, and the impact that systems and policies (Ex. Redlining) have had on the education system as a whole.",,,,,Somewhat disagree,Somewhat agree
