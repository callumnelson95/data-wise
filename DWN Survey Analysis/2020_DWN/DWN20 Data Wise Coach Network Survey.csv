As a woman of color, I can speak my truth, which means I must take responsibility for the words I say, however, the potential for being perceived in a way other than intended is still situated in and often impacted by the degree of implicit bias others bring to the situation.  In many instances hierarchy is always at play and backlash (overt or covert)  is the outcome...the person from the minority group speaking their truth has to make a more difficult choice than the person hearing the truth from the dominant group ""being open to different perspectives"". I am told to speak my truth but I am well aware that professionals around me are white men and women whose lives have been shaped by the privilege they live with. Therefore, if the group with the power of privilege may receive what I am saying and then deny me access in anyway because of my speaking my truth, I am not likely to really speak that truth. The issue is that in most cases the outcome (hidden punishment) sits away from the moment in time when the ""truth"" words are spoken so the power of the group norms/agreements are not in play to offer protection for the ""truths"" spoken. The norm is a first step but it is a small one toward changing what is a larger issue where the primary responsibility should not be on the persons of color but the persons who have shaped and benefitted from institutions that affirm and solidify their advantage and access to mostly those that look like them (and often think like them). Even sharing this is uncomfortable because it is my ""truth"".

This past summer, a public high school reached out to me to elicit my thoughts on how they might ensure equitable access with their student populations, while  encouraging the staff to become more data literate. As I listened to the ""need list,"" one of the administrators commented (in a terse tone), ""I would really prefer that you help us tap a few individuals to become data experts for the school. That's the solution."" I began to pack my belongings and as I stood up, responded, ""If you already have the solution, you don't need me."" Baffled, the administrators and staff asked how I would address their practice problems. I explained it would be better to build a culture where the entire school participated in analyzing data, and deciphering the implications for improving learning and teaching. I further noted that doing so would increase the chances that the school would look at data differently; They could use it to inspire staff rather than burden them with ""another thing."" What I was really suggesting was how to make conversations around data part of the everyday work. The school team decided they would ""try my approach,"" which embedded Meeting Wise and Data Wise, with a lens on equity. I will be able to talk more about improvements with the school's problem of practice, in the next impact survey.
