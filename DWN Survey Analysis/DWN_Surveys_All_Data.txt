"Meeting Wise meetings are the earliest and most tangible wins that teams experience. When I began working with a leadership team recently to coordinate a project training school leadership teams in Data Wise, I introduced a rolling agenda, the concept of rotating roles, norms, and plus/delta in our first meeting. The effect was tangible: the team commented at the effectiveness of our meeting. I noticed immediate trust and confidence that our work will be purpose and relationship-driven.

"My work is more familiar to the DWN given that it is coordinated by Kathy and Rob. With my dissertation it has been fun to see examples of teachers who are changing their practice, and a significant part because of Data Wise work, and that this can happen even in cases where Data Wise is not fully implemented. As I discuss in an AERA presentation, teachers have made changes to their practice prompted by aspects of Step 3, 4, 5, and 6 (not just Step 6).

"I can't speak for the Data Wise educators in the field, but as a HGSE student (and I'm not sure I can imagine this changing in my next role as a post-doc or assistant professor or whatever else) I don't think I can justify paying additional money to be part of a network that I feel like I support through my actions, and do worry that that expectation could likely run counter to Data Wise's mission for scaling impact (i.e., it could constrain the # of certified coaches). This seems like a fairly negligible source of revenue (100 coaches' annual fees would equal to less than the revenue of 1 in-person DWI team), and, in my mind, the much more important factor in deciding who should be part of the network is who is actually contributing in important ways to Data Wise work. Paradoxically, those who contribute the most (and quite often happily do so at a return lower than what they could likely receive doing similar kinds of work in other contexts) may be the most likely to have a hard time spending their own money to be part of such a network. Just my two cents!"

"After the beginning of the school year my central office team (on which I am the only Data Wise trained individual) was asked to help schools with troubleshooting and improving their data meetings and PLC's. We had to go into schools, observe a meeting, and quickly turnaround a set of plus/deltas and recommendations. I used my understanding of the Data Wise and Meeting Wise processes to create two tools: First, a rubric that my team members could use to identify and name what I knew would be likely strengths and weaknesses of what schools were already doing. Second, a list of realistic steps that could be proposed to schools to begin making improvements in their process that would help them get more mileage out of the work they were doing. The district is likely to roll out a formal data meeting process in the next couple of years (I am pushing for Data Wise), and my hope is that this will lay the groundwork for getting traction in schools when that happens."

"During the 2018 DWSI the topic regarding ""equity"" being explicitly lifted with the implementation of the process or allowing it to surface was brought top of mind, as a result of that discussion I asked a team of leaders to ponder this question. Mostly all landed with explicitly stating equity should be the focus during the implementation of the process. The team felt there should be to points to consider:    1.) The statement has been even further clarified with not defining the term and allowing teams to explore and decide what ""equity"" means for them.  2.) Additionally, the teams also agree this should be in Step 1 of the process, however, not in the initial introduction of the step. With the understanding that teams will continue to address portions of Step 1 throughout the timespan of one cycle, there may be spaces where the notion of ""equity"" may have greater ""impact"".   As a result of this collective conversation, the influence of conversations addressing equity has become more prevalent without the term being stated. We noticed there is evidence of a more equitable focus on addressing student groups. Teachers are seeking supports differently for this student group.

"Collaborative teacher time is one of the single greatest levers to push in schools to improve student outcomes. Using a structured process like Data Wise alongside guidance from Meeting Wise on how to build efficiencies into those meetings takes pressure off of teacher leaders to ""guess"" about what their team should be doing next. All of that mental energy, instead, goes to analyzing student work, reading professional resources and trying new strategies, and observing and debriefing each other's classroom practice.

"The survey was a representative mix of questions to determine the activity (current and future) of existing coaches. As a coach that has gone through a major shift in how DWIP is used in my daily work, how I include my coaching skills and knowledge has also shifted. Much of this school year (and now) I am acquainting myself with how to include DWIP when the district no longer ""embraces"" it holistically. Given my new context and experience, I am learning what DWIP looks like at a district level when the district embraces DWIP and then whey they don't. Amidst change and intense shift, there is a story emerging that I am thinking through."

"In my new role as a Clinical Assistant Professor in the School of Education at Loyola University Chicago, I work with a group of professors in the Andrew Greeley Center for Catholic Education which supports all learners in Catholic schools nationwide by teaching on inclusive practices.  In early September, I facilitated a meeting on ""organizing for collaborative"" work where we adopted meeting norms, defined a way to adhere to norms, understood each other work style preferences, and committed to using Meeting Wise to capture the learning from our regular meetings.  Since this meeting, we are engaged in wise meetings: the agendas follow the Meeting Wise checklist in the form of a rolling agenda.  I used a gradual release approach by creating the agendas and facilitating the first three meetings.  The roles in meetings rotate; however, I create the agenda for the meetings.  A professor on our team serves on an academic and curriculum committee and she is using a rolling agenda with the Meeting Wise template.  The professors from other departments that serve on the academic and curriculum have praised the organization, structure, and efficiency of their meetings due to the Meeting Wise protocol.  I will be inviting departments on teaching the Meeting Wise protocol.  A different professor is going to use it in meetings she is organizing for Clinical Assistant Professors; she was dismayed that the first meeting did not use the Meeting Wise template.  It is my hope the Meeting Wise protocol grows in our School of Education.  Just like the book says, great meetings are like great classrooms.  After experiencing wise meetings or great classroom instruction, it is so hard to go back to less effective practices."

"In my work at my school (NYC public elementary) I have facilitated and coached Data Wise with all grade level teams pre-k to grade 5. This year we have extended this work to include enrichment teachers (music, drama, tech, art, dance, and gym) as their own team. This work is evolving as they have decided to focus in on Social Emotional learning. It is a work in progress, and we are learning how to manage this diverse team with one focus. It has been very successful so far and we look forward to having their research benefit the entire school and staff."

"For the past several years, I have had the most impact by co-chairing the Data Wise Institute in June, where I teach Data Wise to a large number of school and system teams. While I see the beginnings of their journeys, I have not had a chance to see what happens after they leave. Through my new role as DW Director of Research, I hope to gather more stories and examples of schools and systems that are using DW to share them with the field and use those stories to design learning experiences for others.

"I am the data inquiry coach for three schools this year, two of which are conducting three cycles of inquiry across all teams. We're starting the second cycle at these schools. Teams are naming specific and small LCPs and are naming collective new instructional approaches to address their problems of practice, often times observing each others' instruction for the first time. One team noticed marked improvement in their students' proficiency on a key reading standard, RI.9-10.1 and RI.11-12.2. They successfully monitored progress to differentiate their lessons for their students who weren't ""getting it"" after the first teach. At this same school, the math team realized that they were so out of alignment with each other that they needed to take a break from inquiry and coordinate - so now, they 9th grade teachers are communicating and collaborating so that their students, who see each teacher once per day, are receiving instruction that is coordinated and strategic rather than haphazard. They also went from being 8 weeks off pace to back on pace. The 10th grade intervention teacher is now using data from the 10th grade Math II teacher to ensure that he's strategically meeting the needs of their learners. This would not have happened without inquiry, and now that they're communicating, they will soon return to collaborative inquiry. The ILT at this school has completed their first ""practice perfect"" meeting, wherein the classroom teachers on ILT modeled differentiation strategies for each other to receive feedback, paving the way for this to happen at the team level as well. At another school, the first and second grade teams dug into understanding the expectations of two standards, and came to some new understandings of what students needed to be able to do to demonstrate proficiency; they looked at student work with this lens and each team named a specific and small LCP that they are digging into together. Both of these schools work with some of the highest proportions of historically marginalized students in the districts - students of color and students with disabilities - so this work will impact the achievement of these groups."

I am currently coaching at the Mildred Avenue K-8 school in Mattapan.  This is their first year doing Data Wise.  The early childhood time investigated early reading behavior data and then generated a POP around improving student engagement and accuracy of practice at centers by building student's metacognitive thinking strategies.  They named individual student conferences and goal setting as the NIA to prepare and practice with students for centers focused on a specific early reading behavior.

"In the last year, I have supported a number of schools and systems in using both Data Wise and Meeting Wise to impact teaching, learning, and building equitable schools. A school I wish to highlight is Adult Education Center in Hartford Public Schools. Adult Education Center is a school with over 600 students in programs to earn a high school diploma (General Education Development or National External Diploma Program) or in the English as a second language program. I coached the leadership team of three on using the Data Wise Improvement Process to impact teaching, learning, and building an equitable school.  I coached the team through key tasks in step 1, and helped them identify sources of evidence for step 2.  The team's focus area is the retention of the adult learners in their school. In addition to attendance data for a data overview, the leadership team wanted survey results for a data overview in step 3. The team developed a survey and I used the Notice/Wonder to provide warm and cool feedback. The team asked if I can also provide feedback on a Spanish translation of the survey, which I did.  At the beginning of their Data Wise journey, the team did not see a connection to their work with adult learners; however, as we discussed the key tasks one step at a time, facilitated a discussion on a focus area, discussed the types of student data to dig into for step 4 (interviews with students and samples of student work), followed by sources of evidence (interviews with staff and school policies) to identify a problem of practice in step 5 is when the team realized the coherence between using Data Wise as a process for their school improvement.    The leadership team identified retention as a focus area knowing that they will choose an academic focus area in the next DW journey.  Retaining students is top priority, however, there is an understanding of the variance in the quality of teaching experienced by students.  The leadership team wants to identify the root cause of retention of students first, followed by an academic improvement cycle using Data Wise.  Coaching a school that supports adult learners is aligned with our DW definition of equity. Also there are unique adaptive challenges that schools serving adult learners have which I found fascinating.  Coaching this school was different than coaching pk-12 schools and I enjoyed discovering alongside with the team how DW can be used to engage in the work of improvement."

"I have used the Meeting Wise in all my High School meeting with faculty. The norms have been very well accepted and we have been practicing them ever since. When the first internal test results have come, we have used Data Wise protocols (Notice/Wonder, Ladder of Inference) to look at data and orient our decisions. We were able then to focus attention on the student (mostly low-income) that most needed help and after one trimester we could observe better results in their tests. Faculty were satisfied to see that we used wisely the little time we had to help those who needed most.

"In the last year, I've coached a caseload of schools as they work towards making Data Wise the way that they do business in CPTs, including some of the most struggling schools in BPS. An especially exciting transformation is happening at one of the schools I partner with where many of the foundations for strong tier 1 instruction (daily lesson plans, strong unit plans, strong assessment plans) have not historically been in place. Because of the adoption of Data Wise, teams are now using common assessments (in ELA and math, and will be this year in science), the ELA team has created and made public unit plans for the year (to varying degrees of quality and completion, but it's there now), the 9th grade math team saw an improvement in interim data scores over the course of the year, and there is an expectation school-wide that everyone is expected to be open about their practice, whether than means sharing student work, sharing videos of teaching, or practicing a new move in both CPT and PD spaces.

I have one short-term delta to offer and one longer-term delta to mention, and about which I'd love to be in collaborative conversation with other DWN members.  First, I think that it might be time for us to revisit the ""assume positive intentions"" norm.  There is much work, particularly in critical social justice literature about the limits of this norm and the ways in which it can work to reinforce dominant systems and structures.  I wonder if the network would be open to thinking about a norm that mentions both ""intentions"" and ""impact,"" and a open to a conversation about ""brave spaces.""  I've long been thinking about this norm, having some discomforts with it from a critical perspective and wondering how it might contradict another fundamental norm of taking an inquiry stance.  Secondly, I am interested in participating in - and potentially leading conversations within the network about the concept of equity.   I would love to gain a greater understanding of what we mean by ""equity,"" support efforts to come to a shared understanding of the concept, and discuss ways to ensure that we are enacting our work in equitable ways and embodying our values, in addition to stating and naming them.  My scholarship in anti-racism and critical social justice, with a focus on whiteness, is growing deeper and I have worthy contributions to make in this area.

"The Meeting Wise agendas, Data Wise norms, and ACE Habits of Mind serve as our foundation for how we interact and engage in collective capacity building in service of all children.  Over the last year, I have continued to develop our new teacher program to not only develop an understanding of our improvement process, but to create experiences that help teachers from multiple content areas ""experience"" the Data Wise Improvement Process.  I continue to tweak the delivery and am challenged sometimes when we only have one new teacher.  However, I know that this learning supports new teachers in serving as integral members of their building-level department and grade-level teams.  We are currently engaging in a systemic Data Wise process focused on improving student attendance.

"Last year, a veteran teacher in Boston (she has been teaching grade 1 for 27 years) video-taped herself teaching for the first time. She watched it twice (once with her daughter) before the meeting where we were going to give her feedback on implementing the New Instructional Approach. She selected two three minute portions of the video to share with her team where she felt she needed the most feedback and then told her team to be brutal with their feedback. She told her entire team how proud she was of herself for doing this and that she couldn't believe they hadn't done this earlier. Later, in our debrief meeting, she told me that it had been so long since she learned something new for her classroom in an authentic, collaborative way and that the process was so intuitive to her. It was one of my proudest moments as a coach. "

"Last year, I completed my doctoral fellowship with the LearnLaunch Institute, in Boston, MA, I developed strategies for scaling and sustaining personalized learning in forty-four public districts in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. As part of my work and research, I crafted an approach to bridge personalized learning and equity of opportunity and achievement for students in 44 public schools across the state. To help achieve these objectives in eight of the schools, I integrated Data Wise cycles and worked with school teams to facilitate wise meetings. While the project was not a formal Data or Meeting Wise effort, I understood that organizations should be mindful to look at data to assess where they are and where they want to go. Integrating these processes in the work of the eight schools, allowed me to help contribute to cultures of continuous improvement, where we examined data often to inform decision-making.

"Last week - I was reflecting with colleagues, and let them know that some days, I felt like one of my most significant gifts for the school system was creating and developing Meeting Wise systems and structures for teams. I felt like I could write a whole capstone or book about the impactful uses of Meeting Wise.  There is GREAT value in this work - and utilizing the concepts and practices has led to much more purposeful, efficient and effective use of time. A key idea is that Data Wise and Meeting Wise is ""CULTURE WORK.""  "

"I really enjoyed working with South Bend schools this past year.  In particular, there was one moment during our on-site training last February.  A teacher, who was a bit of a prickly pear throughout the morning, opened up to the teaching team in the afternoon.  During the afternoon session, each member of the team shared our personal ""why"" and connected it to the Data Wise process, centering equity in the work.  The teacher was moved by this and said she understood the importance of the work and hoped her school team could also build a shared purpose focused on equity."

"I agree with the shift however it is only a surface approach to a deeper issue. As a woman of color, I can speak my truth, which means I must take responsibility for the words I say, however, the potential for being perceived in a way other than intended is still situated in and often impacted by the degree of implicit bias others bring to the situation.  In many instances hierarchy is always at play and backlash (overt or covert)  is the outcome...the person from the minority group speaking their truth has to make a more difficult choice than the person hearing the truth from the dominant group ""being open to different perspectives"". I am told to speak my truth but I am well aware that professionals around me are white men and women whose lives have been shaped by the privilege they live with. Therefore, if the group with the power of privilege may receive what I am saying and then deny me access in anyway because of my speaking my truth, I am not likely to really speak that truth. The issue is that in most cases the outcome (hidden punishment) sits away from the moment in time when the ""truth"" words are spoken so the power of the group norms/agreements are not in play to offer protection for the ""truths"" spoken. The norm is a first step but it is a small one toward changing what is a larger issue where the primary responsibility should not be on the persons of color but the persons who have shaped and benefitted from institutions that affirm and solidify their advantage and access to mostly those that look like them (and often think like them). Even sharing this is uncomfortable because it is my ""truth"". But, for the growth and greater good of the Data Wise project, I will take the risk of responding transparently with my perspective."

"I have found in my research and coaching that ""assume positive intentions"" resonates a lot with educators, and is often internalized. I understand how it potentially could work against efforts at disrupting implicit biases or systemic forms of racism. I think I've seen it used in a way that is more likely to make a safe space for those ideas to be interrogated. So, I have ambivalence, I would say, about the shift.

Working with a regional high school (Ararat SC) in this COVID year supporting teams of teachers complete inquiry cycles in the area of student writing has had its challenges. State wide law enforced stay at home restrictions has meant most students and teachers have tried remote learning from home. However with less than 8 weeks left of the school year we do have action plans being implemented. It's being a significant effort to have the whole school in 4 teams experience their first inquiry cycles (on writing).

I have noticed this year, this continues to be a problem at this school especially as they navigate through these difficult times.  I plan to discuss this with the leadership team and again coach them to revisit their individual, but also develop a shared why to help bring the staff together.

"I have changed districts since July, and I have approached this in multiple ways. I am just beginning my work in this district, but have been using Data Wise Steps 1 & 2 and Meeting Wise protocols to impact teaching and learning during our faculty meetings. The focus of these lessons has been mainly focused on increasing educator's understanding of their own implicit bias and microaggressions, and how this impacts student learning.  I am also working with the School Counseling Department on a Data Wise cycle. We are currently in Step 3/4 and are working on analyzing student data to determine how to better support students in the school. Prior to our last Data Wise Meeting, I worked with Diverse Holliston to organize a training with the department to better understand systemic racism, which was followed up with deeper discussions on addressing microaggressions in the school community.  The work with the School Counseling Department is slated to continue throughout the school year. The school's English Department recently approached me to begin working with them and help begin a Data Wise cycle to analyze data and evidence around the current curriculum and providing a more culturally proficient curriculum.

The team and I focused on using 5th grade Interim Assessment data for the district due to the fact that this grade level performed poorly on the Smarter Balanced Assessment.

"Perhaps this is more of a reflection than a story. This past summer, a public high school reached out to me to elicit my thoughts on how they might ensure equitable access with their student populations, while  encouraging the staff to become more data literate. As I listened to the ""need list,"" one of the administrators commented (in a terse tone), ""I would really prefer that you help us tap a few individuals to become data experts for the school. That's the solution."" I began to pack my belongings and as I stood up, responded, ""If you already have the solution, you don't need me."" Baffled, the administrators and staff asked how I would address their practice problems. I explained it would be better to build a culture where the entire school participated in analyzing data, and deciphering the implications for improving learning and teaching. I further noted that doing so would increase the chances that the school would look at data differently; They could use it to inspire staff rather than burden them with ""another thing."" What I was really suggesting was how to make conversations around data part of the everyday work. The school team decided they would ""try my approach,"" which embedded Meeting Wise and Data Wise, with a lens on equity. I will be able to talk more about improvements with the school's problem of practice, in the next impact survey.

"In July 2020, I entered a public school district that had experienced a high level of leadership change. In the past 10 years, there had been 9 Superintendents. Due to the inconsistency in leadership and some situations that resulted in broken relationships and siloed ways across departments, I worked closely with executive leadership within and across Educational Services + Student Support Services department to create emergent collaborative spaces, meeting structures and professional learning towards increasing a whole-child based approach and supports. We also looked into ways to better bridge the use of data and strengthen tools to support school leaders. Starting with relational trust, ACE habits, and Meeting Wise tools strongly supported this work."

"As you may know, Hartford Public Schools is in its third year of systemic Data Wise implementation. When Covid hit in March, professional learning and coaching for school-level data teams was halted as critical priorities for supporting student remote learning emerged.  The systems-level data team became very concerned about Covid's impact on the work done to improve data teams. This fall, with Koru's support, we resumed support of school data teams.  During a full-day workshop on November 18, all school data teams fully participated in Data Wise professional learning.  The teaching team was impressed by the manner in which school data teams have synthesized Data Wise habits and practices into their work.  Rolling agendas are common place, vocabulary is no longer new, protocols are embraced easily and participants were flying through creation of action plans and measures.  We are so excited to see progress when we check in on action plans after winter break."

"I was not aware of this proposed change to norms.  I can see how ""assume positive intentions"" can dismiss feelings of marginalized groups and I agree with changing the norm to ""speak your truth and be open to other perspectives"" so long as judgment is deterred.  This adds the lens of equity to the norms; however, all people must understand that everyone has different perspectives, truths and experiences that they must acknowledge.  However, I don't agree with removing ""taking responsibility for impact.""  Continuous improvement is everyone's collective responsibility and this seems to let the team off the hook.  Why remove this part?."

"Prior to the pandemic, I worked with Semitropic School District (a small, rural k-8). Their team lived in Step 8 for most of the year. We were doing regular classroom observations of math talks with sentence frames as a strategy approach. The teams progres benchmarks increased, with the last results just before shut down. Unfortunately, we were unable to see the state result outcome, but the team is working through Step 5 of the process right now for an ela focus to add to the math. As a school team, they are getting more comfortable with the process and talking more regularly at all staff meetings about data and Teaching and Learning!!!

"Speak your truth reminds me of the component of Self-Authorship in Adult Development theory.  Although I believe in self authorship, I feel that it is a concept that can be misused and usually without regard to how this may impact others.  The difficulty in Speak Your Truth and Be Open to Other Perspectives is that it assumes that you will know how to incorporate other perspectives into your meaning making system.  Unless you are familiar with adult development and are very self-aware of where you are at in that continuum of development, then you will need further coaching on how to not only receive other perspectives, but how to make sense of your reaction to them and how to absorb them into your current meaning making system."
