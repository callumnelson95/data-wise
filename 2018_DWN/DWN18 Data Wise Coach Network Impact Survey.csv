This seems like a fairly negligible source of revenue (100 coaches' annual fees would equal to less than the revenue of 1 in-person DWI team), and, in my mind, the much more important factor in deciding who should be part of the network is who is actually contributing in important ways to Data Wise work. Paradoxically, those who contribute the most (and quite often happily do so at a return lower than what they could likely receive doing similar kinds of work in other contexts) may be the most likely to have a hard time spending their own money to be part of such a network.

Mostly all landed with explicitly stating equity should be the focus during the implementation of the process. The team felt there should be to points to consider: 


1.) The statement has been even further clarified with not defining the term and allowing teams to explore and decide what ""equity"" means for them. 
2.) Additionally, the teams also agree this should be in Step 1 of the process, however, not in the initial introduction of the step. With the understanding that teams will continue to address portions of Step 1 throughout the timespan of one cycle, there may be spaces where the notion of ""equity"" may have greater ""impact"". 

As a result of this collective conversation, the influence of conversations addressing equity has become more prevalent without the term being stated. We noticed there is evidence of a more equitable focus on addressing student groups. Teachers are seeking supports differently for this student group.

Additionally, supporting the efforts of expanding institutes in other destinations I plan to assume planning and mentoring opportunities through both national and international platforms.

I have seen the reinvigorated energies resurface when teachers are learning to learn together and seeking the answers for improving student performances by changing their own practices. I want to continuing to explore the notion of equity and how it should be brought to the process will be an ongoing focus for me as I influence teachers with transforming their own instructional practices.

In early September, I facilitated a meeting on ""organizing for collaborative"" work where we adopted meeting norms, defined a way to adhere to norms, understood each other work style preferences, and committed to using Meeting Wise to capture the learning from our regular meetings.  Since this meeting, we are engaged in wise meetings: the agendas follow the Meeting Wise checklist in the form of a rolling agenda.  I used a gradual release approach by creating the agendas and facilitating the first three meetings.  The roles in meetings rotate; however, I create the agenda for the meetings.  A professor on our team serves on an academic and curriculum committee and she is using a rolling agenda with the Meeting Wise template.  The professors from other departments that serve on the academic and curriculum have praised the organization, structure, and efficiency of their meetings due to the Meeting Wise protocol.  I will be inviting departments on teaching the Meeting Wise protocol.  A different professor is going to use it in meetings she is organizing for Clinical Assistant Professors; she was dismayed that the first meeting did not use the Meeting Wise template.  It is my hope the Meeting Wise protocol grows in our School of Education.  Just like the book says, great meetings are like great classrooms.  After experiencing wise meetings or great classroom instruction, it is so hard to go back to less effective practices.",I have done this in the last year,,I have done this in the last year,,I have done this in the last year,,I have done this in the last year,,I have done this in the last year,,,,,"I enjoy serving as a mentor to coach candidates because I find that work to be dual capacity building.

We're starting the second cycle at these schools. Teams are naming specific and small LCPs and are naming collective new instructional approaches to address their problems of practice, often times observing each others' instruction for the first time. One team noticed marked improvement in their students' proficiency on a key reading standard, RI.9-10.1 and RI.11-12.2. They successfully monitored progress to differentiate their lessons for their students who weren't ""getting it"" after the first teach. At this same school, the math team realized that they were so out of alignment with each other that they needed to take a break from inquiry and coordinate - so now, they 9th grade teachers are communicating and collaborating so that their students, who see each teacher once per day, are receiving instruction that is coordinated and strategic rather than haphazard. They also went from being 8 weeks off pace to back on pace. The 10th grade intervention teacher is now using data from the 10th grade Math II teacher to ensure that he's strategically meeting the needs of their learners. This would not have happened without inquiry, and now that they're communicating, they will soon return to collaborative inquiry. The ILT at this school has completed their first ""practice perfect"" meeting, wherein the classroom teachers on ILT modeled differentiation strategies for each other to receive feedback, paving the way for this to happen at the team level as well. At another school, the first and second grade teams dug into understanding the expectations of two standards, and came to some new understandings of what students needed to be able to do to demonstrate proficiency; they looked at student work with this lens and each team named a specific and small LCP that they are digging into together. Both of these schools work with some of the highest proportions of historically marginalized students in the districts - students of color and students with disabilities - so this work will impact the achievement of these groups.",,,,I plan to do this in the coming year,,,,,,I plan to do this in the coming year,,,,"So it turns out I was not a particularly productive member of the network this year. I attempted to attend an equity training but unfortunately Darnisa was ill and the session was cancelled. Sarah and Curtis brought back their learning to our team after they went last January, though. This year I would like to attend one portfolio review and participate in an equity training. I can be very insular with the BPS Data Wise community, so I'd like to carve out some time to learn with and contribute to the larger DWN.

But I think that a better minimum level of engagement for me as an individual and perhaps all individuals in the DWN is to participate in a portfolio review or collaborative learning experience with network members outside of their day-to-day professional experience.
