Although I have no issue with this activity, for me, the noise triggered significant distress. I was quite shaken afterwards, and it took me some time to recover and reengage in the learning. 
I know this is a great activity with students, but I am mindful in a school setting of noise levels, especially for students with autism, special needs, and/or backgrounds of trauma. On a positive note, this activity reminded me of how these students may feel in this situation, and the importance of considering the backgrounds of learners when engaging in unexpected activities.","Completely
