The Data Wise Network will be a vibrant, member-led professional learning community with the mission of helping its members work to support Data Wise’s vision: educators collaborating so ALL students thrive.

 

The Network will include all of the engaged certified Data Wise coaches, members of the Data Wise Advisory Board, and the faculty and staff leaders of the Data Wise Project at Harvard Graduate School of Education.

 

The Data Wise Network will become its members’ first stop for professional learning and advice. Members will call on one another when they are looking for inspiration or support with a dilemma. Members will connect with one another to strengthen relationships and ensure that the expertise within the Network benefits all its members, and the teachers and students they serve.

 

Even as the network grows larger and larger over time, it will continue to feel like a family. Network members will uphold the Data Wise norms and ACE Habits of Mind during their interactions with one another.  When members of the Data Wise Network interact, whether they are working together for the first or hundredth time, they will know that they can trust one another to assume positive intentions, celebrate one another’s successes in achieving impact, and push one another to dig deep as they work for equity.","Regarding your photo on the Data Wise Project website, which of the following applies to you?",Please attach new photo here: - Id,Please attach new photo here: - Name,Please attach new photo here: - Size,Please attach new photo here: - Type,"Regarding your biography on the Data Wise Project website, which of the following applies to you?",Please attach new bio here: - Id,Please attach new bio here: - Name,Please attach new bio here: - Size,Please attach new bio here: - Type,"Preferred email address (where you check your email, and where we will send you a small amount of emails from us):",Gmail Address (we need this to be able to share coach resources with you):,Current Job Category:,Current job title:,Current employer:,"50 States, D.C. and Puerto Rico",List of Countries,Please list any languages that you are comfortable teaching in:

A school I wish to highlight is Adult Education Center in Hartford Public Schools. Adult Education Center is a school with over 600 students in programs to earn a high school diploma (General Education Development or National External Diploma Program) or in the English as a second language program. I coached the leadership team of three on using the Data Wise Improvement Process to impact teaching, learning, and building an equitable school.  I coached the team through key tasks in step 1, and helped them identify sources of evidence for step 2.  The team's focus area is the retention of the adult learners in their school. In addition to attendance data for a data overview, the leadership team wanted survey results for a data overview in step 3. The team developed a survey and I used the Notice/Wonder to provide warm and cool feedback. The team asked if I can also provide feedback on a Spanish translation of the survey, which I did.  At the beginning of their Data Wise journey, the team did not see a connection to their work with adult learners; however, as we discussed the key tasks one step at a time, facilitated a discussion on a focus area, discussed the types of student data to dig into for step 4 (interviews with students and samples of student work), followed by sources of evidence (interviews with staff and school policies) to identify a problem of practice in step 5 is when the team realized the coherence between using Data Wise as a process for their school improvement.  

The leadership team identified retention as a focus area knowing that they will choose an academic focus area in the next DW journey.  Retaining students is top priority, however, there is an understanding of the variance in the quality of teaching experienced by students.  The leadership team wants to identify the root cause of retention of students first, followed by an academic improvement cycle using Data Wise.  Coaching a school that supports adult learners is aligned with our DW definition of equity. Also there are unique adaptive challenges that schools serving adult learners have which I found fascinating.  Coaching this school was different than coaching pk-12 schools and I enjoyed discovering alongside with the team how DW can be used to engage in the work of improvement.",Yes,,"The learning from the equity workshops has helped deepen my understanding of an equitable school and equitable school practices. For example, I am now fully aware that at the heart of the DWIP is equity.  Therefore, when I am coaching a school, our DW definition of equity is top of mind.  Which is why I met with Adult Education Center outside of the scheduled pod coaching sessions because they have technical and adaptive challenges for me to understand so that I can support their work in remedying these challenges. I asked how can the students at Adult Education Center feel respected and celebrated for who they are? An outcome of this discussion was the survey in English and Spanish, followed up with interviews to ensure student voices are respected and celebrated so that the school can interrupt patterns of inequity in adult learners.

I have one short-term delta to offer and one longer-term delta to mention, and about which I'd love to be in collaborative conversation with other DWN members.  First, I think that it might be time for us to revisit the ""assume positive intentions"" norm.  There is much work, particularly in critical social justice literature about the limits of this norm and the ways in which it can work to reinforce dominant systems and structures.  I wonder if the network would be open to thinking about a norm that mentions both ""intentions"" and ""impact,"" and a open to a conversation about ""brave spaces.""  I've long been thinking about this norm, having some discomforts with it from a critical perspective and wondering how it might contradict another fundamental norm of taking an inquiry stance.  Secondly, I am interested in participating in - and potentially leading conversations within the network about the concept of equity.   I would love to gain a greater understanding of what we mean by ""equity,"" support efforts to come to a shared understanding of the concept, and discuss ways to ensure that we are enacting our work in equitable ways and embodying our values, in addition to stating and naming them.  My scholarship in anti-racism and critical social justice, with a focus on whiteness, is growing deeper and I have worthy contributions to make in this area.

To help achieve these objectives in eight of the schools, I integrated Data Wise cycles and worked with school teams to facilitate wise meetings. While the project was not a formal Data or Meeting Wise effort, I understood that organizations should be mindful to look at data to assess where they are and where they want to go. Integrating these processes in the work of the eight schools, allowed me to help contribute to cultures of continuous improvement, where we examined data often to inform decision-making.
